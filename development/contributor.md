# Pelias Contributor

We want to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute to the Pelias
project.

For repeat contributors, we generally extend an invitation to join the [Pelias
contributors GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/pelias/teams/contributors).

Joining this team allows you to create new branches and pull requests
_directly_ in repositories that are a part of the Pelias org. Hopefully this
saves some time and hassle!

Because contributors can create branches in Pelias repositories, our [project
infrastruture](./project_infra.md) will also ensure that Docker images are
automatically built and generated for those changes. This can greatly speed
development in combination with our [Docker projects](https://github.com/pelias/docker).
